### Refactoring 

        I was tasked with refactoring the Horiseon webpage. After observing the code i quickly understood that i would have to make some alterations since there were redundencies. Also, and most importantly 
        the web page was not meeting the ADA standards so i had to make sure 
        that it was complient with thoes standards by adding alt tags on img.
        Furthermore, i made sure that the html had semantic elements to make 
        it code readable and purposeful.

### Steps 
    
* Replaced div with semantic elements for readability and meaningfull tags 
    * removed <div> replaced with <section>, <article>
* Added alt tags to images for ADA compliance
    * <img= src"" alt="" > alt tags were added to all picture on the webpage 
* consolidated css selectors
    * selectors with the same properties were combined and seperated with a space and a comma
* reorganized headings to follow sequential order
    * <h1>, <h2>, <h3>
* removed id selector and kept class for consistency 
    *  (#) was changed to (.) in the css to reflect change in html
